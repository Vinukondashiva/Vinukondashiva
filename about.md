Hi, I'm Sivamani Vinukonda, a final-year B.Tech (Hons) student specializing in Cybersecurity.

My main focus is on practical, hands-on security. I am actively working towards a career as a **SOC Analyst**, diving deep into tools like Splunk, Wireshark, and Nmap. I love automating security tasks and building secure infrastructure, which is why I enjoy working with Python, Bash, and Terraform.

I believe in "building in public" and am always solving challenges, which is how I achieved a **Top 8% global rank on TryHackMe**.

### Core Skills

* **Programming & Automation:** Python, Bash, Terraform, Git
* **Cloud Platforms:** AWS (IAM, EC2, S3), Microsoft Azure
* **Security Tools:** Splunk, Wireshark, Burp Suite, Nmap, Nessus
* **Concepts:** Network Security, Vulnerability Management, OWASP Top 10
